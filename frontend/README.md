# Frontend Setup for Virtual Study Environment

This is the frontend for the **Virtual Study Environment** project, built using **Flutter**. It allows users to interact with the backend, track their study sessions, and engage with other users.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Flutter SDK**: [Download Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
- **Dart SDK**: Comes with the Flutter SDK, so no need to install separately.
- **Android Studio** (or Xcode for macOS): For building and running the app on an emulator or physical device.
- **Firebase**: We use Firebase for authentication and real-time database integration. [Set up Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/flutter/setup) if you haven't already.

## Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

If you haven't already, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/virtual-study-environment.git
cd virtual-study-environment
